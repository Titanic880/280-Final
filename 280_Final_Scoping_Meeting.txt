#Final 280 Scoping
#Remote Help App

Additional Explination:
	.When requesting it should prompt a messagebox w/ Yes/No; (Can use a single object with a bool for incoming or outgoing)
	.Encrypted Messaging:
		.Keys will be generated when a connection is established (or keys are premade and distrobuted with program)
	.Database implementation will exist within the Standards class library,
	which means even after seperating the projects they will both have the same code to access the DB

Things i Hope to implement:
	
	.Host Is the Helpee (Client)
	.Connector is the Helper (Server/Host)
	.Allow the Helper to request keyboard control and/or mouse control seperately
	.Passing of DataTypes should not happen (Should always be a user created datatype)
	.User accounts built similar to the 275_Final
	.File Transfer w/ prompt (File Transfer object {Name of file + Byte[]})
	.Allow users to upload a file to showup on a small box? (store the image as a byte[])
	.Determine if i want to save the image or pass it through to a different process to send it to the client
	.Encrypted messaging
	.Basic Chat features
	
Helper Features:
	.The picturebox that shows the image itself will be a smaller size but same ratio (won't need to convert then)
	.Request a share screen
	.Focus of the picturebox is needed for typing/clicking to get sent to the Helpee
	.if attempting to send a input to the Helpee and it is current disabled prompt the helper if they wanna ask for control
	.
	
Helpee Features:
	.Hide the picture form/intergrate it into the main Form (Similar to OBS?)
	.Allow the setting of a timer for how long the control is given to the Helper
	
	
Objects to be used:
	.User (DB Saved)
	.Control (bool Keyboard_access, 
	bool Mouse_access, 
	int Timer_Duration, 
	bool Sender(determines if its being sent or recieved))(Not saved)
	.User_Input (Datapacket of what the user input is)
	
	.File_Standard (String FName, Byte[] File) (Db Saved? (only if accepted?))
	.Possibly something for image? (depending on what the primitive type of the image is)
	.
